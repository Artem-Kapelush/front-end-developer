					A web developer is a specialist who creates new and maintains existing websites. Most often, a web developer works in a team with a designer, tester and manager. He can also work both on the appearance of the site and on its internal, server part. Testing, although not the main one, is also one of the tasks of web programming.<br><br>
					Online banks, social networks and marketplaces are also sites, only with a more complex structure and functionality. Because of this, they are called web applications, but these services are developed and supported by the same web developer.

						The history of the web developer profession is not so old and dates back to the 90s of the last century. Then the Internet was not so widespread - a graphical interface was required. In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee outlined his concept of a computer platform, which led to the emergence in 1990 hypertext markup language - HTML.
					</p>
					<p class="history__text">
						The first sites were not popular, so web developers were not in demand. However, the Internet, over time, began to appear in every home. It was at that moment that web developers began to be in demand. and site development technologies.
					</p>
					<p class="history__text">
						Now a web developer is one of the most sought-after professions in the world. This is due to several reasons. Firstly, today every second person has access to the Internet and therefore it is very important to satisfy everyone. Secondly, the Internet industry is at the peak of its popularity and until there is a replacement for it. And thirdly, there are very few experienced web developers and therefore they are mostly in large corporations.
